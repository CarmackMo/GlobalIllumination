# Global Illumination

## Introduction

This is a simple global illuminator developed based on the principle of ray tracing technology with C/C++. I used *Lanbert* equation as the ray tracing model of this illuminator.

The outcome of the global illumination can be seen in the following image. There are five spheres in a closed room (The wall that at the same position of users' screen has no color). The light source is at the top of the room. The sphere on the right-top corner and the two spheres on the right-down corner use smooth material, while the rest of the spheres use rough material.
